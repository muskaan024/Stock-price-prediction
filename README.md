# Stock-price-prediction
This project aims to predict stock prices using various machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical stock price data and advanced algorithms, we seek to develop models that can forecast future stock prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy. This repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Features
Data Collection: Download and clean historical stock price data from financial APIs.
Feature Engineering: Create features from raw data, including technical indicators and lagged variables.
Modeling: Implement multiple machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.
Visualization: Plot stock price trends, predicted vs. actual prices, and feature importance.
